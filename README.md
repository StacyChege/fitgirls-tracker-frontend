## üíª User Flows

### Signing Up and Logging In

**Standard User**
- Navigate to the `/signup` page.
- Fill out the registration form with your desired username, email, and password.
- Upon submission, a POST request is sent to the `/api/users/register/` endpoint.
- If successful, you will be redirected to the login page.
- On the `/login` page, enter your credentials. A POST request is sent to the `/api/users/login/` endpoint to get an access token. This token is saved to localStorage for future authenticated requests.

**Expert Trainer**
- Navigate to the `/experts/signup` page.
- Fill out the form, including expert-specific fields like Specialty and Years of Experience.
- The form sends a POST request to the `/api/experts/register/` endpoint.
- The backend creates an expert profile. You can then log in via the regular `/login` page using your new expert credentials.

### Accessing Workouts and Experts
- **Workouts:** The `WorkoutListPage` component fetches workout data by making a GET request to the `/api/workouts/` endpoint.
- **Experts:** The `ExpertsPage` component fetches trainer profiles via a GET request to the `/api/experts/` endpoint.
